# Some Feedback from Lionel

* Reusability: Not recommended to hardcode numbers or string in the code when they should be in a constant file
* Perf: The function `transactionRequest` should not do 2 sequential await if they could be done at once. (Asynchronouse power of Nodejs)
* Logic: The fn `confirmTransaction` should update the balances at once and in a transaction [Here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#typeorm-transactions). 
* Perf: Can use Redis to cache some of the values that do not change often...Example `calculateTransactionFee` fn 


Etc. ... Courage

## Project Requirements
- User should signup by filling all required information, when validation rules are respected and then new record is created otherwise response is shown with error happened underneath.

- To meet KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure we should verify user identity. For Rwandese users only,  `NIDA API` should be invoked to validate National ID then we should also send OTP validation to confirm user phone number. (We might validate international identity and phone number in the next version)

- User should be able to regenerate New OTP when previously sent OTP was not recevied or expired.

- Registered user should use phone number and password to login yet response body show status code  along with appropriate message when user credentials are valid, a JWT token is returned to authenticate user to the protected routes.

- Authorized user should be able to create one wallet by currency later on providing name and currency.

- Authorized user should be able his or her list wallets 

- Authorized user should be able to get his or her specific wallet by using wallet id.
- We would love to do work on topup and withraw your wallet to MoMo or Bank acount but due to the small amount of time we may work on this in the future (Next releaseðŸ˜Ž). For now when a user creates a new wallet s/he should get a bonus of 5000 USD to use (It's too much money, but for the sake of test) 

- Sender should provide  `destination wallet id, transaction amount and currency` then s/he should recieve an OTP to confirm transaction in 5 minutes otherwise transaction fail. Here cron job should be running every 10 minutes to check transactions that have not been confirmed and mark them as failed.
- If transaction is confirmed, destination wallet we should remove transaction amount and fee to the source wallet and add transaction amount to the destination wallet. (Fee is our incomeðŸ˜›)

- Authorized user should be able to get a list of his/her transfer transactions
- Authorized user should be able to get a list of his/her transfer transactions by status
- Authorized user should be able to get a list of his/her wallet received transactions
- Authorized user should get a specific transaction detail by providing its ID
